# Informed_rrt_star algorithm implementation

In this project, Informed RRT* Algorithm has been implemented. For the simulation framework and base rrt & rrt* implementation, <https://github.com/motion-planning/rrt-algorithms> has been used. This project contributes the implementation of the Informed RRT* algorithm and comparing multiple scenarios to measure performance/effects.
Installation:
- `conda create env -n rrt python=3.8 -y`
- `conda activate rrt`
- `pip install numpy Rtree plotly matplotlib`


Usage:
- `cd examples/algorithms`
- `python rrt_<File To Execute>.py`
